<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p>CSS的规范中，有一个很奇特的特性，支持计数器的功能。</p>
<p><mark>注释：如果已规定 !DOCTYPE，那么 Internet Explorer 8 （以及更高版本）支持 counter-increment 属性。</mark></p>
<p>示例如下：</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title></title>
	<style type="text/css">
		body {counter-reset: steps;}
     	p{ color: #242424; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px;}
     	p:before { counter-increment: steps;content: "第" counter(steps) ": ";font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<section>
     <p>Place the flour in a large bowl, make a well in the centre and pour in the milk and eggs. Give the liquid mixture a quick whisk before incorporating the flour. Continue to whisk until you have a smooth batter.</p>
     <p>Now add 1 tbsp vegetable oil and whisk thoroughly.</p>
     <p>Take a crêpe pan, or large frying pan, dip some kitchen roll in the oil and carefully wipe the inside of the pan. Heat the pan over a medium heat for one minute.</p>
     <p>Add just under a ladleful of batter to the pan and immediately start swirling it around the pan to produce a nice even layer.</p>
     <p>Cook the pancake for approximately 30-40 seconds. Use a palette knife to lift the pancake carefully to look at the underside to check it is golden-brown before turning over. Cook the other side for approx 30-40 seconds and transfer to a serving plate.</p>
